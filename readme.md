# BOM Weather Radar on Leaflet map

This project eventuated over an afternoon after I had discovered the Bureau of Metereology (BOM) Weather Tile Server, I wrote some basic code that will periodically grabs the latest timestamp for the radar tiles, and then draws that over the top of a [leaflet.js}(https://leafletjs.com/) map.
